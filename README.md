# OffGridCalc

OffGridCalc is a full-stack application designed to size off-grid solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays and battery storage systems. It analyzes user-uploaded load profiles and location-specific solar irradiance data to determine optimal system configurations.

## Architecture

The project consists of a React frontend and a Python FastAPI backend.

### Backend

The backend is built with Python and FastAPI. Python was chosen as the backend language to support the future integration of Machine Learning models for advanced load forecasting and system optimization.

### Frontend

The frontend is built with React and Vite, providing an interactive interface for users to upload data and view simulation results.
